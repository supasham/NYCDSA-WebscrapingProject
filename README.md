# NYCDSA-WebscrapingProject
Webscraping project in Python for NYCDSA - December 2020

This is the Python code for SHameer Sukha's project for NYCDSA

Instructions for use:
1) 'Test - Scrape Vivino using API' is an experimental Python notebook that uses BeautifulSoup to directly query www.vivino.com
2) 'LCBO using BeautifulSoup' is a Python Notebook that scrapes www.lcbo.com for red wine data using BeautifulSoup
3) 'Vivino using BeautifulSoup' uses the data scraped from the LCBO website to query the search feature of www.vivino.com to obtain number of reviews and average rating
4) 'Analysis of LCBO and Vivino data' is a Python notebook that analyses, stitches and cleans the data scraped from LCBO and vivino websites.
6) The R-shiny app can finally be used on prepared data to obtain insights around wine prices vs ratings.

If you live in Ontario, this should help you figure out which red wine to buy!
